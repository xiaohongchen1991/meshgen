== System installation ==

This library is header only. So you can either copy `include/*.hpp` to `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/include`, or add `include` to your search path.

== Building the examples and tests ==

It is preferable to build out of source. Make a build directory somewhere, and then
do the following, where `${DIR}` is the path that you checked out `meshgen`
to:

  cmake ${DIR}
  make

To run the tests, you have to configure `meshgen` with another flag:
   cmake -D BUILD_TESTS=ON ${DIR}
   make
   make test
